# Overview

Lit Protocol is a decentralized key management network that solves the fundamental Web3 security dilemma: how to manage secrets without compromising security, user experience, or decentralization. The network empowers developers to create secure, decentralized applications that manage crypto assets, private data, and user authority seamlessly across any blockchain or distributed system.

Traditional approaches force an impossible choice. Giving private keys or credentials to centralized servers creates massive security responsibilities and single points of failure. Putting the burden entirely on end users requires them to navigate complex key management and opens up avenues for compromise. Lit Protocol eliminates this tradeoff.

Lit's distributed architecture ensures secrets remain verifiably secure - encrypted at the hardware level and fragmented across a decentralized network with no single point of failure. Using threshold signature schemes (MPC TSS) as a foundation means that for the first time, universal accounts can be programmed and automated without trusting centralized custodians.

This underlying security architecture enables powerful developer capabilities. Using Lit's SDK, builders can easily:

- Encrypt and decrypt private data
- Create and manage Web3 wallets, accounts, and signers
- Sign transactions and messages on virtually any blockchain
- Execute automated signing and/or decryption operations based on programmable conditions
- Read and write to any off-chain endpoint to ensure compatibility with legacy systems and the rest of the web2 world

These capabilities enable builders to create immutable, interoperable, and user-owned applications, AI agents, and protocols.
